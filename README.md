# Expense Manager Application

## üìå Project Overview
The **Expense Manager** is a console-based Java application designed to help users manage their expenses effectively. Users can add, view, and calculate the total of their expenses, categorized into **Food Expenses**, **Utility Expenses**, and **Entertainment Expenses**. Each category stores additional specific details, making the application flexible and easy to extend.

The program leverages the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase.

## üåü Object-Oriented Programming Principles in Action

### 1. **Abstraction**
   - The `Expense` class acts as an abstract base class that defines the blueprint for all expense types.
   - Each expense type (`FoodExpense`, `UtilityExpense`, `EntertainmentExpense`) implements the abstract method `displayDetails()` to display category-specific details.
   - This hides unnecessary details from the user while ensuring essential information is handled properly.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - Fields such as `description`, `price`, and category-specific attributes (e.g., `mealType`, `utilityType`) are marked as `private` and accessed via **getter and setter methods**.
   - Data validation, such as non-negative prices in `setPrice()`, ensures the integrity of the stored data.

### 3. **Inheritance**
   - `FoodExpense`, `UtilityExpense`, and `EntertainmentExpense` inherit common properties (`description`, `price`) and behavior from the `Expense` superclass.
   - This reduces code redundancy and promotes reuse of common functionality.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   - The program uses **runtime polymorphism** to call the appropriate `displayDetails()` method for each expense type.
   - For example, a single `viewExpenses()` method in `ExpenseManager` can handle all types of expenses dynamically.

## üåç Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production
This project aligns with **SDG 12**, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. By categorizing and monitoring their expenses, users are encouraged to:
- Reflect on their spending habits.
- Make informed decisions to minimize waste.
- Budget responsibly to promote financial and environmental sustainability.

The app fosters mindful consumption by helping users track and categorize their expenditures, ultimately contributing to responsible resource usage.
